                <p class="card-subtitle">Amazon AWS SageMaker (Software Development Engineer Intern) </p>
                <p class="card-summary">
                    During my time as a software developer, I was involved in several impactful projects. One of my major achievements was collaborating on improving the SageMaker GroundTruth machine learning platform. Additionally, I implemented the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication protocol to two existing resources, which was a significant security improvement. To ensure that my work was well-documented, I authored a comprehensive 5-page documentation on three major feature changes. I also took the initiative to initiate 11+ code reviews, which were approved and pushed into the AWS production pipeline. To ensure that the code was deployed in all regions, I submitted five or more tickets to outside teams. Furthermore, I collaborated with outside teams to update the AWS public documentation for two SageMaker resources. During the process, I discovered two major bugs in legacy code and promptly implemented a hot-fix for both, which helped to improve the overall quality and reliability of the software.

                <h2 class="card-title">About</h2>
                <p class="card-summary"> am an enthusiastic computer engineering student with a passion for creating impactful software solutions. With a strong academic record and hands-on experience, I have developed proficiency in multiple programming languages such as C/C++, Java, Python, Ruby, TypeScript, and JavaScript, and I am always eager to learn more. I am well-versed in software engineering, agile methodologies, and test-driven development, and I thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments. As a former intern at Amazon AWS, I contributed to the development of the SageMaker GroundTruth data labeling service, where I demonstrated my exceptional problem-solving and attention-to-detail skills. In my free time, I actively participate in the Texas A&M Computing Society and hackathons, where I continuously hone my skills and stay up-to-date on the latest industry trends. I am a scholarship recipient and possess excellent communication, teamwork, and adaptability skills. I am excited to bring my creativity and passion to a full-time software development engineer position where I can make valuable contributions and grow both personally and professionally</p>
